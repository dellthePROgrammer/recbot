# 🔐 Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Clerk authentication for your RecBot application with role-based access control.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. A Clerk account (free tier available)
2. Your RecBot application running

## 🚀 Step 1: Create Clerk Application

1. **Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)**
2. **Click "Add application"**
3. **Configure your application:**
   - **Name:** RecBot Audio Manager
   - **Sign-in options:** Email, Google, Microsoft (choose what you prefer)
   - **Environment:** Development (for testing)

## 🔑 Step 2: Get API Keys

1. **In your Clerk Dashboard, go to "API Keys"**
2. **Copy the following keys:**
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

## 🔧 Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` file in your RecBot root directory:**
```bash
# Frontend Clerk Configuration
REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here

# Backend Clerk Configuration  
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here

# Your existing AWS and other configs...
STORAGE_TYPE=aws
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id-here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key-here
AWS_REGION=your-aws-region-here
AWS_BUCKET=your-aws-bucket-name-here
```

2. **Add the environment variables to your docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
services:
  recbot:
    image: ghostreaper69/recbot:latest
    environment:
      - REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
      - CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
      # ... your existing environment variables
```

## 👥 Step 4: Configure User Roles

### In Clerk Dashboard:

1. **Go to "Users" section**
2. **Click on a user to edit**
3. **Go to "Metadata" tab**
4. **Add to "Public metadata":**
```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```
**OR**
```json
{
  "role": "member"
}
```

### Role Definitions:

- **`admin`**: Can access all files, admin dashboard, database management
- **`member`**: Can only view files associated with their email address

## 🔒 Step 5: Configure Authentication Settings

### In Clerk Dashboard → Settings:

1. **Sessions:**
   - Set session lifetime as needed (default 7 days is fine)

2. **Restrictions:**
   - Enable "Restricted to allowlist" if you want to control who can sign up
   - Add email addresses or domains to the allowlist

3. **Social Connections (Optional):**
   - Configure Google, Microsoft, etc. if desired

## 🌐 Step 6: Configure Allowed Origins

1. **In Clerk Dashboard → "API Keys"**
2. **Add your domains to "Allowed origins":**
   - `http://localhost:3000` (development)
   - `https://your-domain.com` (production)

## 🚀 Step 7: Deploy and Test

1. **Rebuild your Docker image with Clerk integration:**
```bash
docker build -t ghostreaper69/recbot:latest .
docker push ghostreaper69/recbot:latest
```

2. **Update your deployment with new environment variables**

3. **Test the authentication:**
   - Visit your RecBot application
   - You should see a Clerk sign-in page
   - Sign up/sign in with your test account
   - Assign the `admin` role to your account in Clerk Dashboard
   - Access the admin dashboard at `/admin`

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### For Admin Users:
- ✅ Can access all audio files
- ✅ Can use admin dashboard (`/admin` route)
- ✅ Can sync database
- ✅ Can view database statistics

### For Member Users:
- ✅ Can only see files containing their email address
- ❌ Cannot access admin dashboard
- ❌ Cannot sync database
- ✅ Clean, filtered interface

### For Unauthenticated Users:
- ❌ Cannot access any files
- ❌ Redirected to sign-in page

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid publishable key" error:**
   - Check that your `REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is correct
   - Ensure it starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`

2. **"User not found" or token errors:**
   - Verify your `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in backend environment
   - Make sure secret key matches your Clerk application

3. **Role-based access not working:**
   - Check user metadata in Clerk Dashboard
   - Ensure role is set in "Public metadata" (not Private)
   - Role must be exactly `"admin"` or `"member"`

4. **CORS errors:**
   - Add your domain to Clerk's allowed origins
   - Check that frontend and backend URLs match

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Production Setup:**
   - Switch to production Clerk keys for live deployment
   - Configure proper domain restrictions
   - Set up user provisioning workflow

2. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Enable MFA in Clerk for admin users
   - Set up webhook for user role changes
   - Configure session management policies

3. **User Management:**
   - Create admin interface for role assignment
   - Set up email templates for user onboarding
   - Configure user deletion/suspension workflows
